# Introduction

The Data Protection Manager Community Extensions PowerShell module contains commands for working with System Center Data Protection Manager and Microsoft Azure Backup Server.
The goal of this module is to make it easier to manage the two products by providing functionality not included in the built-in Data Protection Manager PowerShell module (also known as DPM Management Shell/Microsoft Azure Backup Management Shell).

# Installation

The module is published to the PowerShell Gallery, which means you can install it using the following command from the PowerShellGet module:

`Install-Module -Name DataProtectionManagerCX`

or the following if you want it installed the current users profile (*$env:userprofile\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules*) rather than the system wide location (*$env:programfiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules*):

`Install-Module -Name DataProtectionManagerCX -Scope CurrentUser`

When a new version is released with bug fixes or new functionality you can update to the latest version simply by typing the following command:

`Update-Module -Name DataProtectionManagerCX`

PowerShellGet is included by default in PowerShell V5, and available downlevel for PowerShell 3.0 and 4.0.

If you want to install the module without leveraging PowerShellGet, you can either clone the Git-repository or download [this](https://github.com/janegilring/DataProtectionManagerCX/archive/master.zip) ZIP-file and place the contains in one of the following locations:
- $env:userprofile\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\DataProtectionManagerCX
- $env:programfiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\DataProtectionManagerCX

# Requirements

- PowerShell 4.0 or later on the computer the module is installed on
- PowerShell Remoting must be enabled on target computers
- Administrative credentials is required on target computers

- **Get-DPMCXAgent** - Returns information about a DPM agent, including version information and attached DPM servers.

Specify -ListVersion to return all build numbers for System Center DPM 2012 R2, System Center DPM 2016 and Microsoft Azure Backup Server. 
- **New-DPMCXRecoveryPointStatusReport** - Not implemented yet. Builds an HTML report for the output generated by Get-DPMRecoveryPointStatus which can be saved to a file path or sent to an e-mail address.
